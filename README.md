# Data Science Internship – Day 02

## Objective
Continue improving the dataset and build stronger machine learning models with proper preprocessing and evaluation.

## Work Done
- Fixed data formatting issues (removed commas from Price column and converted to numeric)
- Handled pandas warnings (SettingWithCopyWarning) using proper indexing
- Performed additional data cleaning and validation
- Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling
- Split dataset into train and test sets
- Trained Random Forest model
- Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report
- Saved model predictions to CSV file
- Debugged multiple code errors and improved notebook structure

## Files Included
